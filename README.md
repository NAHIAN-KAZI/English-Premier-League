# EPL Dataset Analysis
Premier League Data Analysis and Visualization

This project focuses on multiple CSV files containing season-wise English Premier League data, merging into a single consolidated dataset. Once merged, the data is analyzed for insights using a Jupyter Notebook, with a focus on data preparation, exploration, and future predictive modeling.

## Project Overview

This project begins by merging multiple `.csv` files for each Premier League season into a single DataFrame. After merging, the data is cleaned, analyzed, and prepared for potential machine learning tasks. The primary goal is to streamline the data for easy access and provide a foundation for future predictive modeling, such as match outcome predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains season-by-season data on the English Premier League.

## Data Preparation

- **File Reading**: The project reads multiple `.csv` files, each representing a different season, and merges them into a single dataset.
- **Data Cleaning**: Basic data cleaning steps are applied, such as handling missing values and converting categorical features as needed for analysis.


## Exploratory Data Analysis

The following analyses are performed on the merged dataset:

- Summary statistics and structure inspection
- Sample data inspection
- Identification of categorical features
- Checking for missing values and handling them as necessary

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install pandas
```
## Usage
-Download the dataset from Kaggle and place the season-wise CSV files in a folder named data.
-Run the merge_csv_files.py script to merge all season files into one consolidated CSV.
-Open EPL Analysis.ipynb to perform exploratory data analysis on the merged dataset.
